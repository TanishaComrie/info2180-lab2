        <p id="D_A"> October 6,2023 by Tanisha Comrie</p>
        <p> The Caribbean truly is a wonderful destination, with its beautiful beaches, warm weather, and rich culture. And the food is one of its highlights! There are so many delicious dishes to try, from Jamaica's Ackee and Saltfish to Trinidad's Calaloo and Crab. I'm getting hungry just thinking about it! Let's visit some countries!
            Trinidad
            The national dish here is calalloo and crab made in the form of a stew made from dasheen leaves, coconut milk, herbs and spices, etc.  Often served with macaroni pie or rice as a side dish.
            Up Next is the mountainous island of Cuba
            Cuba
            A dish dating to Cuba's Spanish Colonization "Ropa Vieja" in other words Old Clothes is now renowned as its national dish. This dish is made with shredded beef that is cooked with tomato sauce, onions, peppers, garlic, and various spices. It is traditionally served with yellow rice and black beans, and sometimes with fried plantains or bread. 
            Last but not least our final stop was Jamaica.
            Jamaica
            Jamaica's National Dish is Ackee and Saltfish, made from a fruit that dated from the 18th century in West Africa and a cheap protein source imported from slavery, saltfish. Usually served with breadfruit, plantain, rice, dumplings, and/or ground provision.

        <h2 id="Title">Green Tea & Diabetes</h2>
        <p id="D_A"> October 6,2023 by Tanisha Comrie</p>
        <p>Green tea is a popular beverage that has been consumed for centuries in many parts of the world. It is rich in antioxidants, polyphenols, and catechins, which may have beneficial effects on health. One of the potential benefits of green tea is its role in the prevention and management of diabetes. Diabetes is a chronic condition that affects the way the body metabolizes glucose, the main source of energy for cells. Diabetes can lead to serious complications such as cardiovascular disease, kidney failure, nerve damage, and vision loss. 

            Several studies have suggested that green tea may help lower the risk of developing type 2 diabetes, the most common form of diabetes. Type 2 diabetes occurs when the body becomes resistant to insulin, a hormone that regulates blood sugar levels. Green tea may improve insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance, as well as reduce oxidative stress and inflammation, which are associated with diabetes. Green tea may also help prevent or delay the onset of type 1 diabetes, an autoimmune disease that destroys the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas. Green tea may protect the pancreatic beta cells from damage and enhance their function.
